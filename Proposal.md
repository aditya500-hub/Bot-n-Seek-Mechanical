# Bot ’n Seek – Project Proposal
Aim
Design and develop an interactive multiplayer robotics game with two rovers navigating a maze arena.  
One rover (Seeker) tags the other (Hider) using a laser system, while the Hider avoids detection.

Rules
1. Bots are placed at opposite ends of a maze-like arena.  
2. The Seeker must tag the Hider within 3 minutes.  
3. The Hider must survive or reach a safe zone.  
4. A hit is detected by light sensors and triggers buzzer/LED feedback.
